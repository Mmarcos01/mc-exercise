1. Ted did a `git pull origin master` into his `Feature Branch` Big no-no
2. Sebsequesntly when Carol and Bob worked on thier feature they did not perform the `git pull origin master` from "Main" prior to going into thier  `Feature Branch` to work.
+ pulling the master into a feature is bad news...Don't do it!

### What should have happened:

1. Everyone does a  `Git pull origin` from main and then creates thier own features to work from
2. The team should dicscuss naming conventions and workflow
3. set a standard, work from well named branches, communicate when a pull request has been made, and when one is ready for review.
4. Have multiple sets of eyes on review, dont leave it all up to one person, this allows for more code review of submitted files.
